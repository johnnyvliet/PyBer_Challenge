# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the total ride fares by city types (Rural, Suburban and Urban) by week using data from Pyber.

## Results 

The results show in the attached multiple line graph [PyBer Fare Summary]("C:\Users\jvanv\Ride Sharing Data\Analysis\Pyber_fare_summary.png") that the total fares do differ by city type.

- Urban cities have the highest weekly fares, as you might expect. 
- Suburban city fares are not as high as urban cities, but greater than rural fares
- Rural fares have the lowest total fares by week, never surpassing $500

Here is a summary of the total rides, drivers, fares, average fares per ride and average fare per driver broken out by city type that also shows the disparities between the cities [Rides and Drivers by City Type Summary]("C:\Users\jvanv\Ride Sharing Data\Analysis\Rides and Driver Summary by City Type.png")

## Summary

Based on the results, please find three recommendations for addressing the disparities among city types:

1. Urban fares are highest given the density of the population and frequency of ride sharing needs. We recommend capitalizing on this area and adding more drivers
2. Suburban cities tend to not need ride sharing as much. However, we recommend continuing offering PyBer in these cities since there is still demand for our services.
3. Rural areas do not generate a lot of fares, we recommend focusing our efforts on urban cities
